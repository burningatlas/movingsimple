Learning about systems in the beginning is quite interesting. It's like coming out of the Windows cocoon and exploring the amazing amount of options and flavours of Linux.

At first it's fascinating -> then, overbearing -> but later it's just what it is. And it's all free use, poke around and play with.

Bandit from OverTheWire is a CTF style playful, gamified way to get beginners used to linux and security concepts.
