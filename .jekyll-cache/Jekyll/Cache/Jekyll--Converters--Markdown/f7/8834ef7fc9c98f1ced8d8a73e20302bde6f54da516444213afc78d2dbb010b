I"¢<p>My name is Pruthvi Raj. Iâ€™ve been working as a Software Engineer for over 12 months. And I have been simultaneously learning and working on my skills for getting into Cybersecuirty domain.</p>

<p>I like to think about a problem like a puzzle and keep working on it. I love making extensive research and gain more knowledge while working on things everyday. Thatâ€™s when I found out about Cybersecurity, under Lockdown early 2021. The depth of all job roles seen in this domain match all the things I would love to be working as a person, everyday.</p>

<p>I love speaking different languages. I can speak English, Kannada and Hindi, learnt Sanskrit in School. I can understand Telugu and Tamil (to an extent). Would love to learn Spanish and Chinese.</p>

<p>I love studying History, Geography, current affairs, DIY hacks and all the small things in life.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll let you know when I find out more about myself.</p>
